🎙️ Speech Recognition Techniques – Basics to Advanced 🚀
By S. Lakshmi Devi (GUVI | HCL Mentor)
Welcome to the Speech Recognition Techniques repository!
This repository is created under the Nan Mudhalvan Scheme by the Tamil Nadu Government, aiming to guide learners from the basics of speech processing to advanced Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) systems with real-time projects and practical applications.

📚 What you'll learn:
✔️ Fundamentals of Speech Signals
✔️ Audio Preprocessing Techniques
✔️ Feature Extraction (MFCC, Spectrograms, etc.)
✔️ Acoustic Modeling & Language Modeling
✔️ Real-Time Speech Recognition
✔️ Deploying ASR Systems
✔️ Mini and Major Projects on Speech Recognition
